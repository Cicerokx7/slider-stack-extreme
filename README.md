Welcome to the repository for a fun 3D game project developed as part of a team project for our Computer Graphics class! In this collaborative effort, we created an engaging game that challenges players to stack falling ingredients on a slider bun while aiming to match menu items. Our game, built using Unity, has reached a stage where several core components have been established.

## Project Overview
Our team has embarked on a journey to craft a captivating 3D game that combines creativity, technical skills, and lessons learned from our Computer Graphics class. With a focus on interactive gameplay and immersive graphics, we're striving to create an experience that both entertains and challenges players.

## Key Achievements
As part of this collaborative effort, each team member has made significant contributions to the development of the game. Here are some my key achievements:

- **Slider Bun Mechanics**: Successfully implemented the bun's sliding mechanics, allowing players to navigate it around the screen.
- **Dynamic Ingredient Spawning**: Created a dynamic system that spawns ingredients from the sky at random locations in front of the player, ensuring an unpredictable and exciting gameplay experience.
- **Ingredient Stacking**: Designed intelligent ingredient stacking mechanics, providing an immersive challenge for players as they stack ingredients atop the bun.

## Conclusion
In developing this 3D game, our collective experiences, including internship experiences and coursework, have played a pivotal role. This project exemplifies the seamless blend of our academic and professional experiences, contributing to our growth as programmers and our understanding of computer graphics.
